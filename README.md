## Computer Science 

### Layers of Abstraction

### Number Systems 

- Number Systems: Decimal = 0-9, Binary = 0, 1, Octal = 0-8, Hexidecimal = 1-9 and a-f.

- There are Conversions for each pair.

- Each Number System has a: Radix, Base, Weight.

- The Radix is the number of Decimals in each Position.

- The Base is the same as the Radix.

- The Weight is the Base and the Power Of.

- The Power Of is the number of the Position. 

- Integers to the left, Fractionals to the right. 

- Decimal: Has no Value. 

- Binary: [1 = (on, yes, true, high)], or, [0 = (off, no, false,low)]. = 1 bit.

- Octal: 8 bits = 1 byte.

- Hexadecimal: Prefix = 0x, Suffix = h. 

- Little Endian = Least significant byte first.

- Big Endian = Most significant byte first. 

```
Dec.  Bin.  Hex.
0     0     0
1     1     1
2     10    2
3     11    3

Hex: 47ed
```

```
Dec Weight: 10*
Bin Weight: 2*
Oct Weight: 8*
Hex Weight: 16*
```

```
Hex: 0x55aa, 55aah.
```

```
Little Endian: 0x55aa, 55aah.
Big Endian: 0xaa55, aa55h. 
```

### Quantum Computing 

- Normal computers are Binary. 1,or 0. A bit. 

- Bit stands for Binary Digit. 

- Quantum computers use Qubits, for Quantum Binary Digits. 

- Qubits can be in Superposition, both 1, and 0, simultaneously. 

- This is called Quantum Entanglement. 

### Electronics 

- Basic Electronics has: Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Transformer, Diode, Transistor.

- The transistor, a silicon semiconductor, was invented in 1956.

- They won a Nobel Prize in Physics for it. 

- We use the letters N, and P to describe a Transistor. NPN, PNP. 

- A Transistor has an Emitter, Base, Collector. 

- It is a Current Controlled Switch. 

- The Electrons would typically flow from the Emitter (N), to the Base (P), to the Collector (N). 

### Circuits 

- An electric current is Analog and in Decimal. 

- It's measured in Volts. 

- (I think the conversion, Analog to Digital, is through ElectroMechanics.) 

- A Digital Circuit is Binary. 

- It's measured in bits. 

- A single wire can carry 1 bit. 

- 1 bit is roughly around 0.6V (off < 0.6V < on).  (Current Control Switch) 

- There are two types of Digital Circuits: Combinational, Sequential. 

- It uses Boolean Algebra and the Truth Table. (Mainly due to Logic.) 

- It has Input/Output.

- It can have Gates.

- It can have Read/Write capabilities.

- 1 or more circuits can form a Latch. 

- A Latch can store 1 bit. Memory. 

- Memory is Octal. 

- A Group of Latches form a Register.

- A grid of Latches with MultiPlexors form a Matrix.

- An Address is the Intersection of a Matrix. Row and Column.

- An Address is Hexadecimal. 

### Registers 

- 32 bit General Register example.

```
32 bit  8 bit  16 bit  8 bit, 
EAX      AH      AX     AL, 
EBX      BH      BX     BL,

SP: Stack Pointer.
```

```
E: 32 bit.
R: 64 bit.
```

### CPU

- There are three main parts to the Central Processing Unit (CPU): The Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), and the Memory Unit.

- The CPU's purpose is to execute Programs.

- Programs are made up of Instructions.

- The Instruction Cycle has four cycles: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Store.

- It takes a certain amount of Machine Cycles to execute an Instruction Cycle.

- Speed depends on the number of Clock Cycles needed to execute an instruction. 

- A Clock Cycle is the time taken between two pulses of an oscillator.

- A CPU performs a Clock Cycle, Machine Cycle, Instruction Cycle, respectively.

### Instruction Format 

- 16 bit Instruction Format:

```
Prefix, OpCode, Mod-R/M, SIB, Disp, Imm.
```
  
- Required:

```
Opcode, Disp, Imm.
```

### Language Processing System

- Process: Pre-Processor, Compiler, Assembler, Linker, Loader, Memory.

- Pre-Processor: Produces Input for the Compiler.

- Compiler Phases: Lexical, Syntax, and Semantic Analyzer, Intermediate Code Generator, Machine independant Code Optimizer, Code Generator, Machine Dependant Code Optimizer.

- Assembler: Translates Assembly Language into Machine Code, and creates an Object file.

- Linker: Links and Merges various Object files to create an Executable.

- Loader/Memory: Loads Executable files into Memory and executes them.

### Programming Languages 

- There are Low Level and High Level Programming.

- They are used to make Intructions that make up Programs.

- They are written in Code.

- Each Programming Language's Intruction Code have their own Syntax.

- Incorrect Syntax will generate an Error.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- Data Structures and Algorithms are an important part of Computer Science.

- Data Structures: Primitive, Non Primitive.

- Primitive: Numeric, Non Numeric.

- Non Primitive: Linear, Non Linear.

- Algorithms: Input, Output, Finiteness, Definiteness, Effectiveness.

- They help CPUs solve Problems.

### Operating System

- An Operating Sytsme is an Interface.

- Four of it's Functions: Memory Management, Processor Management, Device Management, File Management.

- It has four Processes: Stack, Heap, Data, Text. 

- It has Scheduling.

- It has Threads.
- 
### Cloud

- Cloud is a Network.

- It refers to manipulating, configurating, and accessing Applications online.

- It offers online data storage, infrastructure and application.

- Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Community.

- Service Models: Infrastructure, Platform, Software, Identity, and Network as a Service.

### Artificial Intelligence

- We are trying to get CPUs to think like Humans.

- Types of Intelligence: Linguistic, Musical, Logical-Mathematical, Spatial, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Intra-Personal, Interpersonal.

- It is composed of: Reasoning, Learning, Problem Solving, Perception, Linguistic.

- Task classification: Formal, Mundane, Expert.

- Machine Learning is a sub of Artificial Intelligence.

This Should Help.

## Boot Process

### Intro

- There are two kinds of Booting: Cold and Warm Booting.
 
- There is Real Mode and Protected Mode. 
 
- The Instruction Pointer (EIP) holds the Memory Addresses of the Instructions.
 
### Reset Vector

- The Reset vector is at `0xFFFFFFF0`.
 
- It is the first Instruction executed. 

- The Motherboard ensures that the Instruction at `0xFFFFFFF0` is a Jump to the memory location mapped to the BIOS Entry Point.  

### Bios

- We start off in Real Mode. 

- The BIOS is the first thing to boot.

- The BIOS is stored on ROM and FLASH Memory, at 0xFFFFF

- It copies itself to RAM, Shadowing. 
- `0xFFFFFFFF` has a jump instruction to where the it Shadowed.

- The BIOS will perform POST.

- It will look for Bootable Devices.
 
- The BIOS will only boot an MBR from a device if that device is in the Boot Sequence, and if it formatted correctly. 

- The BIOS will load the Master Boot Record at `0x7c00`, containing the Bootloader.

### Master Boot Record 

- When the BIOS looks for Bootable Devices:
 
- It calls code stored in the Master Boot Record at the start of disk 0. 

- It launches the first 440 bytes (the Master Boot Record Bootstrap Code area). 
 
- The next 6 bytes are for Optional Code. 

- The next 64 bytes (4 x 16) are for four Partion Code. 

- The BIOS iterates through the Master Boot Record/Boot Sector, the first 512 bytes.

- This ends in `0x55, 0xaa`.

- The Master Boot Record is the Boot Sector of a Hard Disk. First 512 bytes. 
 
- There are three sections to the Master Boot Record: Master Boot Routine, Disk Partition Table, Identification Code.

- The first 446 bytes `0x000 - 0x1BC` hold Bootstrap and Optional Code, the Master Boot Routine. The next 4 x 16 bytes `0x1BE - 0x1EE` contain four Partitions, the Disk Partition Table. The last 2 bytes `0x1FE`, are for the Boot Signature, `0x55, 0xaa`, Identification Code. 

- The Boot Signature tells the BIOS it is bootable. 

- The Master Boot Record will load the Bootloader. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Code. 

### Bootloader

- It has First Stage, Second Stage, Embedded and Multi Stage, and Network Booting. 

- It will Load Filesystem Drivers, Configuration File, Supporting Modules, Display Menu, Load Operating System. 

- The Bootloader will start the Kernel at `0x100000`. 

### Kernel 

- We are in Protected Mode.

- There are Main, and SubSet Kernel Models. 

- Main: Monolithic, Micro Kernels. 

- SubSet: Hybrid, Modular, Nano, Exo, Kernels

- They act as a Interface between User Applications and Hardware.

- They're the Core Components of an Operating System.

- They have four functions: Memory management, Process management, Device Driver, and System calls and Security.

- The Kernel initializes the Operating System.

### Operating System

- The Operating System is an Interface between User Applications and Hardware. 

- It takes full control with the Kernel running in the background.

- It will run it's own initializations. 

That's it!

## Conclusion

- Computer Science helps explain what a Cpu is and does. 
 
- The Booting Process helps explain what happens when you turn your computer on.

- This is the Boot Process. Cold/Warm Boot. BIOS, Master Boot Record, Bootloader, Kernel, Operating System.

- Most Installed Programs are not Open-Source, so I'm using Open-Source Coreboot (BIOS), Limine (Bootloader), and Serenity (Operating System), as examples.

- All Programs coded with research, using Visual Studio Code IDE, with knwoledge of Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Number Systems, Assembly, Python, and C/C++ Programming Languages. 

- For testing the Programs, Emulated with QEMU, and Assembled with NASM.

- This is for X86 ISAs made by Intel and AMD.

I'll be one step closer to designing the Reactors.
